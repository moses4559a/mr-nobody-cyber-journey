# Networking Basics – TryHackMe

This repository documents my **core networking fundamentals** learned through **TryHackMe**, including theory + practical exposure.

---

## 📌 What This Repo Covers

* OSI Model (7 Layers)
* TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)
* IPv4 Addressing
* Public vs Private IPs
* Ports & Services
* TCP vs UDP
* TCP Three-Way Handshake
* Encapsulation
* Telnet Practical (TCP communication)

This repo is meant to show **clear fundamentals**, not copy-paste theory.

## 🧱 OSI Model (Quick Overview)

| Layer | Name         | Purpose                               |
| ----- | ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| 7     | Application  | User-facing services (HTTP, FTP, DNS) |
| 6     | Presentation | Encoding, encryption, compression     |
| 5     | Session      | Session management                    |
| 4     | Transport    | End-to-end delivery (TCP, UDP)        |
| 3     | Network      | Routing & IP                          |
| 2     | Data Link    | MAC addressing                        |
| 1     | Physical     | Cables, signals                       |

## 🌐 TCP/IP Model

| TCP/IP Layer | OSI Mapping |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Application  | OSI 5,6,7   |
| Transport    | OSI 4       |
| Internet     | OSI 3       |
| Link         | OSI 2       |

## 📍 IPv4 Addressing

* IPv4 uses **32 bits (4 octets)**
* Each octet range: **0–255**
* Example: `192.168.66.89`

### Private IP Ranges (RFC 1918)

* `10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255`
* `172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255`
* `192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255`

---

## 🚪 Ports

* Used to identify applications on a host
* Range: **1–65535** (16-bit)

Common ports:

* HTTP → 80
* HTTPS → 443
* FTP → 21

---

## 🚚 TCP vs UDP

### TCP – Transmission Control Protocol

* Reliable
* Connection-oriented
* Uses **3-way handshake**
* Used for web, email, file transfer

### UDP – User Datagram Protocol

* Fast
* Connectionless
* No delivery guarantee
* Used for streaming, games, VoIP

---

## 🎁 Encapsulation

Data is wrapped layer by layer:

```
Application Data
→ TCP Segment / UDP Datagram
→ IP Packet
→ Ethernet / WiFi Frame
```

On the receiver side, the process is reversed.

---

## 🧪 Practical: Telnet

Used `telnet` to interact directly with TCP services:

* Echo server (Port 7)
* Daytime server (Port 13)
* HTTP server (Port 80)

This helped understand:

* TCP connections
* Ports
* Raw HTTP requests

---

## 🎯 Platform

* Learning Platform: **TryHackMe**
* Focus: Networking fundamentals for cybersecurity

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

* Deeper TCP/IP analysis
* Wireshark packet inspection
* Network scanning (Nmap)

📌 *This repository represents my foundation in networking and will be expanded as I progress.*
