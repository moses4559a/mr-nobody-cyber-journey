# Day 4 — Linux Recon Bash Script

## What I did
- Built a basic Linux reconnaissance script using Bash
- Ran and tested it on Kali Linux
- Learned script permissions and execution
- Pushed the project to GitHub using token-based authentication

## Project
The `linux-recon` script collects:
- Current user
- System information
- Current working directory
- Directory file listing

## How to run
```bash
cd linux-recon
chmod +x recon.sh
./recon.sh
